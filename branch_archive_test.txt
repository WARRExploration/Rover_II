This is a test branch to show how to delete unused branches
without removing them from the history.

The unwanted branch is tagged as 'archive/branch_name', then deleted.
This way it is possible to restore the branch later and retrieve the commits.

Workflow:
git tag archive/sprintjuly2010 sprintjuly2010
git branch -d sprintjuly2010
git push origin :sprintjuly2010
git push --tags

To restore a branch:
git checkout -b sprintjuly2010 archive/sprintjuly2010

I followed this example:
