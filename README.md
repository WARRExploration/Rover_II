# Rover_II


We are the [WARR exploration](https://exploration.warr.de), a student team from Munich. We are developing a Rover to compete in the ERC. As an inspiration for people we decided to make our rover open source. Feel free and take a look on what we have done! Our goal is the ERC 2019 wich will take place in september, so until then there will be a lot of changes!

## Repositories
This is the Main repository of the second rover we build.
We have a couple of other repositories to structure our code a little bit.
* [Rover II](https://github.com/WARRExploration/Rover_II)
  * rover_config: all the configuration files (urdf, ...)
  * rover_control: files to set up ros_control controller
* [Simulation](https://github.com/WARRExploration/rover_sim) 
* [Automation](https://github.com/WARRExploration/rover_automation)
* [Arm](https://github.com/WARRExploration/rover_arm)
* [GUI](https://github.com/WARRExploration/rover_gui)
* [Electronics](https://github.com/WARRExploration/rover_electronics)
