We are the [WARR exploration](https://exploration.warr.de), a student team from Munich. We are developing a Rover to compete in the ERC. As an inspiration for people we decided to make our rover open source. Feel free and take a look on what we have done! Our goal is the ERC 2019 wich will take place in september, so until then there will be a lot of changes!
